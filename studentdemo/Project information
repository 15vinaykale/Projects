Hi there,

This attached project has CRUD operations created using Spring Boot, H2, JPA annotations & JPARepository.
Additionally provided the Exception class to show RESOURCE NOT FOUND with proper block.
Kindly take checkout -> try to add some data first using Post method (as i have used H2 DB which is in-memory database), afterwards do other operations like Get, Put, Delete -> to check Exception try to pass some id which is not available.

Happy coding..!
